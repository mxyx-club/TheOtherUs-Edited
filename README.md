2. Find the folder of your game. You can right click on the game in your library, a menu will appear, click on properties, local data, browse
3. Go back one folder to common and make a copy of your Among Us game folder and paste it somewhere on the same drive.
4. Now unzip and drag or extract the files from the .zip into your Among Us game folder that you just copied, at the `.exe` level (just into the folder).
5. Run the game by starting the .exe from this folder (the first launch might take a while).

Not working? You might want to install the dependency [vc_redist](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

## Windows Installation Epic
1. Download the newest [release](https://github.com/SpexGH/TheOtherUs/releases/latest)

3. Now unzip and drag or extract the files from the .zip into the original Epic Among Us game folder.
4. Run the game by starting the game in your Epic Games launcher (the first launch might take a while).

Not working? You might want to install the dependency [vc_redist](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

![Install](https://i.imgur.com/pvBAyZN.png)

## Linux Installation
1. Install Among Us via Steam
2. Download newest [release](https://github.com/SpexGH/TheOtherUs/releases/latest) and extract it to ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Among Us

## The Other Roles Custom Servers
**A custom server is not necessary and official servers are working just fine with the mod, but in case you want to set up and host your own server, here's a guide for you to follow.**

**Setup the Server:**
1. Get the Impostor release (https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor)
2. Follow the steps (using the server release you just downloaded) on the official Impostor-Documentation (https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/wiki/Running-the-server)
3. Make sure to set the following values to false in the config.json file:
```    ...
     'AntiCheat': {
       'Enabled': false,
      'BanIpFromGame': false
    }
```
4. Make sure to forward the right ports on the hosting machine.
5. Run the server and setup the client.
Setting up Server as Docker Container:
If you want to run the server as a docker container you'll need to use the image
aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

(Currently only the 'nightly' tag is starting a server supporting 2021.3.31 or later)
In addition to running it we need to set the environment variables to disable the AntiCheat feature.
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false

Example to docker run command:
docker run -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

Or use to run it in the background
docker run -d -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

**If you have any problems regarding custom servers, please contact https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor or https://discord.gg/ThJUGAsz**

# Custom Hats
## Create and submit new hat designs
We're awaiting your creative hat designs and we'll integrate all the good ones in our mod.
Here are a few instructions, on how to create a custom hat:

- **Creation:** A hat consists of up to three textures. The aspect ratio of the textures has to be `4:5`, we recommend `300px:375px`:
  - `Main texture (required)`:
    - This is the main texture of your hat. It will usually be rendered in front of the player, if you set the `behind` parameter it will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern *hatname.png*, but you can also set some additional parameters in the file name by adding `_parametername` to the file name (before the *.png*).
    - Parameter `bounce`: This parameter determines whether the hat will bounce while you're walking or not.
    - Parameter `adaptive`: If this parameter is set, the Among Us coloring shader will be applied (the shader that replaces some colors with the colors that your character is wearing in the game). The color red (#ff0000) will be replaced with the primary color of your player and the color blue (#0000ff) with the secondary color. Also other colors will be affected and changed, you can have a look at the texture of the [Crewmate Hat](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/e/e0/Crewmate_hat.png) to see how this feature should be used.
    - Parameter `behind`: If this parameter is set, the main texture will be rendered behind the player.
  - `Flipped texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Main texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_flip.png`.
  - `Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back.png`.
  - `Flipped Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Back texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back_flip.png`.
  - `Climb texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered in front of the player, when they're climbing.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_climb.png`.
- **Testing:** You can test your hat design by putting all the files in the `\TheOtherHats\Test` subfolder of your mod folder. Then whenever you start a Freeplay game, you and all the dummies will be wearing the new hat. You don't need to restart Among Us if you change the hat files, just exit and reenter the Freeplay mode.

- **Submission:** If you got a hat design, you can submit it on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/yspVyP5meR). We'll look at all the hats and add all the good ones to the game.

# Roles

## Role Assignment

First you need to choose how many special roles of each kind (Impostor/Neutral/Crewmate) you want in the game.
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough Crewmates/Impostors in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:
- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players.
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (there exists a ticket pool for Crewmates, Neutrals and Impostors). Then the roles will be selected randomly from the pools as long it's possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more Crewmates/Impostors or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.
- The Mafia, Lovers and Mini are being selected independently (without using the ticket system) according to the spawn chance you selected. After that the Crewmate, Neutral and Impostor roles are selected and assigned in a random order.

**Example:**\
Settings: 2 special Crewmate roles, Snitch: 100%, Hacker: 10%, Tracker: 30%\
Result: Snitch is assigned, then one role out of the pool [Hacker, Tracker, Tracker, Tracker] is being selected\
Note: Changing the settings to Hacker: 20%, Tracker: 60% would statistically result in the same outcome .



## Mafia
### **Team: Impostors**
The Mafia are a group of three Impostors.\
The Godfather works like a normal Impostor.\
The Mafioso is an Impostor who cannot kill until the Godfather is dead.\
The Janitor is an Impostor who cannot kill, but they can hide dead bodies instead.\
\
**NOTE:**
- There have to be 3 Impostors activated for the mafia to spawn.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Mafia Spawn Chance | -
| Janitor Cooldown | -
-----------------------

## Morphling
### **Team: Impostors**
The Morphling is an Impostor which can additionally scan the appearance of a player. After an arbitrary time they can take on that appearance for 10s.\
\
**NOTE:**
- They shrink to the size of the Mini when they copy its look.
- The Hacker sees the new color on the admin table.
- The color of the footprints changes accordingly (also the ones that were already on the ground).
- The other Impostor still sees that they are an Impostor (the name remains red).
- The shield indicator changes accordingly (the Morphling gains or loses the shield indicator).
- Tracker and Snitch arrows keep working.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Morphling Spawn Chance | -
| Morphling Cooldown | -
| Morph Duration | Time the Morphling stays morphed
-----------------------

## Camouflager
### **Team: Impostors**
The Camouflager is an Impostor which can additionally activate a camouflage mode.\
The camouflage mode lasts for 10s and while it is active, all player names/pets/hats\
are hidden and all players have the same color.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Mini will look like all the other players
- The color of the footprints turns gray (also the ones that were already on the ground).
- The Hacker sees gray icons on the admin table
- The shield is not visible anymore
- Tracker and Snitch arrows keep working

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Camouflager Spawn Chance | -
| Camouflager Cooldown | -
| Camo Duration | Time players stay camouflaged
-----------------------

## Vampire
### **Team: Impostors**
The Vampire is an Impostor, that can bite other player. Bitten players die after a configurable amount of time.\
\
**NOTE:**
- If a bitten player is still alive when a meeting is being called, they die at the start of the meeting.
- The cooldown is the same as the default kill cooldown (+ the kill delay if the Vampire bites the target).
- If there is a Vampire in the game, there can't be a Warlock.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Vampire Spawn Chance | -
| Vampire Kill Delay | -
| Vampire Cooldown | Sets the kill/bite cooldown
-----------------------

## Eraser
### **Team: Impostors**
The Eraser is an Impostor that can erase the role of every player.\
The targeted players will lose their role after the meeting right before a player is exiled.\
After every erase, the cooldown increases by 10 seconds.\
The erase will be performed, even if the Eraser or their target die before the next meeting.\
By default the Eraser can erase everyone but the Spy and other Impostors.\
Depending on the options they can also erase them (Impostors will lose their special Impostor ability).\
\
**NOTE:**

## Jackal
### **Team: Jackal**
The Jackal is part of an extra team, that tries to eliminate all the other players.\
The Jackal has no tasks and can kill Impostors, Crewmates and Neutrals.\
The Jackal (if allowed by the options) can select another player to be their Sidekick.
Creating a Sidekick removes all tasks of the Sidekick and adds them to the team Jackal. The Sidekick loses their current role (except if they're a Lover, then they play in two teams).
The "Create Sidekick Action" may only be used once per Jackal or once per game (depending on the options).
The Jackal can also promote Impostors to be their Sidekick, but depending on the options the Impostor will either really turn into the Sidekick and leave the team Impostors or they will just look like the Sidekick to the Jackal and remain as they were.\
Also if a Spy or Impostor gets sidekicked, they still will appear red to the Impostors.

The team Jackal enables multiple new outcomes of the game, listing some examples here:
- The Impostors could be eliminated and then the crew plays against the team Jackal.
- The Crew could be eliminated, then the Team Jackal fight against the Impostors (The Crew can still make a task win in this scenario)

The priority of the win conditions is the following:
1. Crewmate Mini lose by vote
2. Jester wins by vote
3. Arsonist win
4. Team Impostor wins by sabotage
5. Team Crew wins by tasks (also possible if the whole Crew is dead)
6. Lovers among the last three players win
7. Team Jackal wins by outnumbering (When the team Jackal contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 Impostors left and team Jackal contains no Lover)
8. Team Impostor wins by outnumbering (When the team Impostors contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 players of the team Jackal left and team Impostors contains no Lover)
9. Team Crew wins by outnumbering (When there is no player of the team Jackal and the team Impostors left)

**NOTE:**
- The Jackal (and their Sidekick) may be killed by a Sheriff.
- A Jackal cannot target the Mini, while it's growing up. After that they can kill it or select it as its Sidekick.
- The Crew can still win, even if all of their members are dead, if they finish their tasks fast enough (That's why converting the last Crewmate with tasks left into a Sidekick results in a task win for the crew.)

If both Impostors and Jackals are in the game, the game continues even if all Crewmates are dead. Crewmates may still win in this case by completing their tasks. Jackal and Impostor have to kill each other.
